# SSIT Work Analysis

SSIT team required me to analyse their work data to give some insights. They worked with Canadian clients for several years.
I analysed which types of software they developed mainly, which skills they use and what about their revenue trends.

## Conclusion
They mainly developed Mobile and Web applications, and a few projects related to computer vision. Their revenue began to grow in 2016 and took its peak in 2017, but in 2018 it started to make a descent.

They need a change, now.
