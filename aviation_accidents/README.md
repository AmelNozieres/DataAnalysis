# Analysis of Aviation Accidents
# [View](https://github.com/Geng-Jie/DataAnalysis/blob/master/aviation_accidents/aviaccs.ipynb)

There I try to find insights through analysing the data set that contains 82,635 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them. 

The data in AviationData.txt file comes from the <a href='https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx'>National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)</a>.

My analysis result is as following:


### Never take the CESSNA planes.

This is the rank of the most dangerous planes.

 1. cessna      33.8%
 2. piper       18.4%
 3. beech        6.4%
 4. bell         2.2%
 5. mooney       1.7%
 6. grumman      1.5%
 7. bellanca     1.4%
 8. boeing       1.2%
 9. hughes       0.9%


### Don't use planes in Summer, especially July.

Accident rate is very higher in summer than winter. Especially, the accident probability in July is as twice as in January or December.

**Fine weather is more dangerous than bad weather.**

92% of accidents occured in good weather but only 7% of accidents in bad weather.

Fortunately, aviation accidents are decreasing as years gone by.


### Almost accidents happen in the United States, and some other places such as Puerto Rico, and China.
