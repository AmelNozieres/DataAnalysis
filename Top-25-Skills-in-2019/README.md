# Top 25 Skills in 2019([SOURCE](https://github.com/Geng-Jie/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Top-25-Skills-in-2019/skill_summarize_2019.ipynb))


Many sites reported about top most job skills in 2019.

But their perspectives for ranking are different, so consideration range or skill names are different from each other. For example, simplilearn.com might have ranked skills using the online student's population, while linkedin.com is considered that they used companies' job postings.

In order to get unbiased ranking result, I gathered ranking data from those sites manually, and summarized them into one ranking list.

The raw data from manual scraping contains so many difference skill names for same skills, so I corrected them into similar categories.

## Conclusion
I summarized the top most skills in 2019 from some sited which reported rank lists. The ranks of the sites are from various perspectives and have difference range or names of skills. The skills I have gathered have so complex inter-relationships such as implication and overlapping. I have tried to make an unbiased result, but I am not sure it is.
